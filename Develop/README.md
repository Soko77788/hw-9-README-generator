  ## Questions
  * Here is a link to my [GitHub](https://github.com/soko77788) profile.
  * For further questions email me at nicksoko@gmail.com.

  ## Tools and 3rd party assistance
  * Influenced with the class node.js day 3 mini project code along
  * Screencastify
  * Student AI tool and ChatGPT for badge information

  ## Obstacles and Successes
  * The biggest obstacle was finding the github license and badge information
  * Importing information from one js file back to the main index.js file
  * Using Screencastify for the first time and getting it uploaded on google drive

  * This homework went smooth. With the mini project code along most aspects were easy to figure out.
  * Screencastify was already installed so getting the recording down reading the docs was great.
